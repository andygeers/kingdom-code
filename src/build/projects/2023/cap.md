Christians Against Poverty's mission is to end UK poverty together; they work with churches across the UK to transform lives, taking action to bring individuals and families out of debt and poverty.

At BUILD 2023 CAP are looking to put some useful and practical information in people's hands so they can understand what poverty looks like at a local level. For churches, this helps them to understand the needs of their community, and what they can help meet. For individuals, it might highlight an area which they're already passionate about, or it could help them to advocate and campaign for systemic change (or nudge their church leaders to do something!).

To do this, the project will be pulling in various open data sources, as well as some specifically that CAP has access to, to paint a picture of what's going on in our country. From this, we would like to create an interactive tool to sit on CAP's website that people can use. It needs make data interesting and accessible for people who probably won't spend all of their time looking at large data sets or complex data visualisations.

Alongside that, if there's anyone very passionate about taking a bunch of data and doing some analysis, just to see what the data is saying, we would love to facilitate you!

How could you use data to tell a story of poverty in the UK so that the local church can take action?
