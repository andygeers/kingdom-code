Stewardship works with over 12,500 ministries and individuals, helping them receive donations from Christians across the UK. Over the last few years Stewardship has been making it easier to find and understand what these organisations do through _Cause Finder_. Cause Finder is made up of unique partner profile pages and help givers find causes close to their heart.

As part of the Cause Finder project Stewardship has identified 26 'Cause Crosses' (charity categories) which now need to be assigned to these 12,500 ministries…

At BUILD Stewardship would love achieve two specific things:

1. All 12,500 of our partners have been assigned up to 3 CauseCrosses that accurately represent what they do.

2. There is an API that Stewardship can use when onboarding new partners which will automatically make the Cause Cross recommendation.

This will demand some kind of AI. The base data sets used for the categorisation would be the charity commission database, the partner’s own web site, and any other generally available data.

How would you help Stewardship begin to categories the partners that they are working with?
