The Church Mission Society (CMS) has a specific training program called 'Pioneering' which ranges from a 1 year program, all the way to a Masters level university course. The pioneer program trains and equips individuals to explore non-traditional ministry opportunities and community engagement.

Next year CMS are launching a 'Pioneer Community'; CMS wants a platform for members of the Pioneer Community – alumni and students of the mission training course – to share and barter resources as well as skills. Pioneers are known for their creativity and innovativeness, and CMS would like to offer the Community a means of collaborating and identifying cross-sections of interest.

Over the course of the hackathon we'll be exploring what digital engagement in this community could be. Initial ideas have started with a resources and skills sharing platform where pioneers can advertise needs for specific skills or offer said-skills within the community… but that's just a starting point.

CMS has a year until the program launches, and wants to start digging out a good foundation during the hackathon.
