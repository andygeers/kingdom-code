year: 2023

[321](https://speaklife.org.uk/321course/) is a self-serve evangelistic course showing life according to Jesus. It is hosted on the Learn Worlds platform and encourages people to join a Discord server to meet with others online using the material, but how might we encourage and enable participants to link up with local churches to carry on the evangelism and discipleship journey offline?

There are a number of "Find a Church" features hosted by mission and denominational ministries but SpeakLife would love for the 321 user experience to connect individuals and groups in a way that feels relational, organic, and friendly.

Over the course of the hackathon what could we design or build that would help people take a conversation on a Discord channel, into the space of a local Christian community?
