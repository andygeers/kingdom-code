Described at the 4th industrial revolution, modern technology affects all areas of our lives; from what we purchase, to how we date, to our energy consumption and employment opportunities. At the next Kingdom Code Think event Rev. Jimmy Lawrence will explore the nature of those changes, how we might think about them from a faith perspective, and crucially what we as technology producers can do about it."

One of the big questions he is facing into at the moment is how can Christians be part of creating and working in a culture where everyone excited and energised by what they do. No small task!"
