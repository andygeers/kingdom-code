How might we put God's word front and centre in our evangelism? It's a great challenge for all Christians, because we're convinced that the Bible present us with _"words of eternal life_" (John 6v68). But how can technology, software development, coding and design help the church answer this kind of question?

It may not seem an obvious fit at first, but for the last five years [Kingdom Code](https://kingdomcode.org.uk) has been working with technologists in the UK and beyond to explore how their skillsets can be used to serve the church. We're convinced that being a technologist in church means more than pressing the next slide button in your lyric projection software, or hiding behind a PA desk… What does it look like to use app development, user experience research, database administration, or dev-ops skills to meet the needs of the church in the 21st century?

Each October we host a 24 hour hackathon called [Kingdom Code BUILD](https://www.kingdomcode.uk/build). We invite this growing community from across the UK and beyond, to spend the weekend with us, digging into challenges like the one posed at the start of this post. We take over a church in London, with excellent Wi-Fi and a comfy crypt to sleep in, and get going– putting our skills to work.

Last year over 120 technologists joined us at BUILD working on ideas to inspire generosity (like automatically rounding up what you spend and donating extra), or working to encourage Bible engagement (see [Bible Trainer](https://bibletrainer.co.uk) as an example). This year we're exploring how we can bring God's word deeper into our evangelism ([details](https://kingdomcode.org.uk/blog/2019/build-19-challenges/#build:ch1)) and how we might resource the local church to serve and include the poor ([details](https://kingdomcode.org.uk/blog/2019/build-19-challenges/#build:ch2)).

If you're someone with ideas, or someone who writes code, or designs software, or project manages… or has a digital toolbox… consider joining us at Kingdom Code BUILD this year.

Kingdom Code BUILD is taking place on Friday 11th – Saturday 12th October 2019. 
During the weekend the event brings together Christians in the world of tech from across Europe to practically explore our how faith in Jesus connects with our technical skills. Find out more at [kingdomcode.org.uk/build](https://kingdomcode.org.uk/build).
